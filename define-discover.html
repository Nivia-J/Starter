          <h4>Why? </h4> <hr>
          <p> How big is the problem of brain drain in India? 
            At 17.5 million, there’s a reason the Indian diaspora is the largest in the world. “Non-residential” Indians are becoming “not-returning” Indians</p>
          
          <p>There has been a constant increase in the migration of Indians to other developmed countries. These migrations are not need based but aspirations based. These migrators are the priviledged ones who got the best opportunities in India, have the brightest brains and once they are ready to work and contribute to the economy, they decide to do it for countries other than their’s. This is a huge human resource loss to India. </p>
          <h4> Purpose & Value</h4>
          <p>REVERSING THE BRAIN DRAIN -
            This phenomenon places a severe drain on India’s resources. Not just due to the loss of human capital, but also due to the additional loss of the investment that the Indian society collectively made to accumulate that level of human capital. The encouragement, support and countless acts of kindness that the society extended to the emigrating individuals. The sad reality of the situation is that the talented people born, raised and educated in India have often bailed out when it was time to work and repay what they were provided. They chose to leave.
            
            For decades, the brain drain has contributed to reduced economic growth, demographic shifts, and limited the innovative capacities of the nation. It has cost us the ability to progress much faster than we currently are. All the more making it very imperative for India to plug the phenomenon. In addition to legislative provisions and jobs creation, it is also important for the society as a whole to accommodate and encourage the reverse brain drain.</p>
