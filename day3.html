    <h3>According to Jennifer L.Aaker - Stories are meaningful when they are - <br>
    </h3>
    <h3>1. Memorable </h3>
    <p> With the old paper effect that the visulaization starts with reminds of the time when things used to happen on paper and was not computerised, one of the main difference in how stock markets operate now as compared to how they used to operate back then. The entire look and feel stays with the reader, establishing a connect. The style of narration is also unique with a mutlimedia use of sound, graphs and video which leaves a strong impression. <br><br>My score for memorability is <b>7</b></p>

    <h3>2. Impactful </h3>
    <p> Though the impact factor does not look that strong But the visualizations are very effectively able to represent the gravity of the impact of the crisis in the world economy and it's long term impact as well.
        <br><br> 
    My score for impactfulness is <b>6</b> </p>

    <h3>3. Personal </h3>
    <p> 
        <br><br> 
    My score for personal touch is <b>7</b> </p>
